# Sensitivity warning 

1. Be excellent to one another. 
2. Don't tell me what to do. 
3. Obey. 

# Not a template 

This project is an experiment. 
It is not a template of best practices on how to do micro services. 
Use your head. 
The folder lives inside a folder called experimental. 

# Not for production 

Do not copy code from here to your production environment. 
Do learn from the stupidity here so you don't make the same mistakes in production. 

# Architecture 

With all this being said, lets jump into the architecture. 
We have a few things here: 

1. User Service 
2. Product Service 
3. Order Service
